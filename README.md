This is the github-repository associated with the manuscript about parameter symmetries as a means to deduce structural identifiability of mechanistic ODE models. In the code folder, you find julia scripts that run a classical global SI analysis using a differential algebra approach. These julia scripts uses "[StructuralIdentifiability.jl](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl)", and in order for this toolbox to work you must use version 1.10 of Julia. All scripts writes the ODEs for the observed outputs into tex-files that are stored in the folder "tex\_files\_with\_output\_ODEs". In the Code folder, we have also included a notebook which displays all the details behind the implementation of the CaLinInv-algorithm when analysing the SI of the SEI-model, and this notebook is called "SEI\_CaLinInv\_recipe.ipynb" which uses "[SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)" in order to conduct all symbolic calculations. We also include a Python script called "SEI\_plot\_and\_validate\_parameter\_symmetries.py" which plots the action of the parameter symmetries of the SEI model as well as plotting a numerical validation of these parameter symmetries. The figures generated from this script are saved in the "Figures" folder. Lastly, all scripts in this repositry are completely open-source.
